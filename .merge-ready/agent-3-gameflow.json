  "summary": "Fixed gameFlow integration tests to handle character selection phase",
  "changes": [
    "Created completeCharacterSelection() helper function",
    "Helper simulates all players selecting characters to reach 'play' phase",
    "Added helper call to 6 test suites that need play phase",
    "All 20 gameFlow integration tests now passing"
  ],
  "rootCause": "Tests were calling standardDraw() and other play-phase moves while still in characterSelection phase, causing 'ERROR: disallowed move'",
  "solution": "Helper function loops through players, selects character, calls endTurn() to advance, until phase transitions to 'play'",
  "testResults": "238/241 tests passing (99%, 3 skipped)",
  "blockedBranches": [

  "impact": "CRITICAL - This fix unblocks 3 branches from merging to main"
